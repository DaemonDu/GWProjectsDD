    <h1>Game Play</h1>
    <p>In this game you have to dodge the spikes to survive. If you touch a spike your game restarts. As time goes on your points will go up. After 10-15 second a BIG spike will fall and you will have to dodge it. As of right now there are some bugs in the game, but do not worry. They are not big enough to break the game. Just do your best and have fun playing.</p>
