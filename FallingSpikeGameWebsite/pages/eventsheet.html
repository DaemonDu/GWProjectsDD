    <h3>What Each Event Does</h3>
    <h4>Game Sheet</h4>
    <p>
        The first one stops the animation and randoms the color. The second one makes it so when you hold click you can move the character. The 3rd one is the thing that spots it from going off the screen. The 4th one is the same but for the right side. The 5th code makes the spike fall and changes the score. The 6th code spawns the spikes every 0.2 - 0.9 seconds 3 times. The 7th event adds 1 score every 0.8 seconds. The 9th event allows the player to be killed, stops the score count, and reveals the HUD. The 10th destroys the spikes the player avoided. 11th restarts layout with a button. The 12th goes back to home layout if you click the button. The 13th event spawns the big spike every 10-15 seconds. The 14th allows the player to be killed by the big spike. The 15th is the start of making it more difficult. The 16th is not finished. The 17th lets the player move up and down. The 18th and 19th are work in progress

    <p>The first one is a button that goes to the game layout. The second is a temporary link that would go to the game site. The 3rd one stops the background animation.</p>
