    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <p>This is a game I made throughout the course of 1-2 weeks. It was fun making this game because we finally were able to something out side of html and brackets. I really enjoyed using construct and I am looking forward to using it more for my future games in the next couple of months.I was in the process of finishing and adding extra things but time ran out. I was trying to figure out how to stop the block from going out the bottom of the screen and how to add powerups. I was also going to add a difficulty level up every 200 points.
